# Scripts-For-the-M100-ROS-DJI-OSDK-
Simple bash scripts for using the ROS DJI OSDK. I also included a python script for creating a squarewave waypoint map and flying that.
Simply change the coordinates seen at the bottom of the python script to auto generate the flight path.
#THIS IS JUST MEANT TO PROVIDE AN EXAMPLE FOR RUNNING THE DJI OSDK FROM COMMAND LINE. I COULDN'T FIND ANY GOOD EXAMPLES SO I THOUGHT OTHERS MIGHT APPRECIATE IT.
