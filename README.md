# Scripts-For-the-M100-ROS-DJI-OSDK
Simple bash scripts for using the ROS DJI OSDK. I also included a python script for creating a squarewave waypoint map and flying that.
Simply change the coordinates seen at the bottom of the python script to auto generate the flight path.

# I couldn't find any other examples for actually running the dji osdk from command line, so I made one. I hope this helps other new users.
